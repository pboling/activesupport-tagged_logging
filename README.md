This is an **unofficial** extraction of Rails' v8 `ActiveSupport::TaggedLogging` backported to work with Rails v5.2+ and Ruby 2.7+.

If this gem is loaded by Rails v8+, it does nothing at all.  NOOP.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add activesupport-tagged_logging

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install activesupport-tagged_logging

## Usage

```ruby
require "activesupport-tagged_logging"
```

### With `activesupport-logger` gem

[`activesupport-logger`][activesupport-logger] is automatically depended on and configured by this gem,
so you don't need to do anything else.

IMPORTANT: When using this gem,
**do not require [`activesupport-logger`][activesupport-logger] in your code.**
Load order matters.

Simplified, the load order is basically:

- Standard `active_support/logger` from the Rails version loaded by your application
- Standard `active_support/tagged_logging` from the Rails version loaded by your application
- This gem's dependency [`activesupport-logger`][activesupport-logger] which was ripped from the Rails v8 beta
- This gem's `activesupport-tagged_logging` which was ripped from the Rails v8 beta

But, again, this is handled for you.

### With broadcasting support

If you want to try an experimental fix from a PR, run:

```ruby
Activesupport::FixPr53105.init
```
NOTE: The bits of logic that are unique to this gem are in the namespace `Activesupport` (sic).

See: https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/53105/files

## 📌 Versioning

This Library adheres to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][📌semver].
Violations of this scheme should be reported as bugs.
Specifically, if a minor or patch version is released that breaks backward compatibility,
a new version should be immediately released that restores compatibility.
Breaking changes to the public API will only be introduced with new major versions.

To get a better understanding of how SemVer is intended to work over a project's lifetime,
read this article from the creator of SemVer:

- ["Major Version Numbers are Not Sacred"][📌major-versions-not-sacred]

As a result of this policy, you can (and should) specify a dependency on these libraries using
the [Pessimistic Version Constraint][📌pvc] with two digits of precision.

For example:

```ruby
spec.add_dependency("activesupport-tagged_logging", "~> 1.0")
```

See [CHANGELOG.md][📌changelog] for list of releases.

## 🤑 One more thing

You made it to the bottom of the page,
so perhaps you'll indulge me for another 20 seconds.
I maintain many dozens of gems, including this one,
because I want Ruby to be a great place for people to solve problems, big and small.
Please consider supporting my efforts via the giant yellow link below,
or one of the others at the head of this README.
